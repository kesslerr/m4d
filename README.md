# m4d -- Is EEG better left alone for decoding?
Multiverse for Decoding (m4d).


The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of preprocessing decisions on the performance of decoding algorithms using multiverse preprocessing. The open \ac{ERP CORE} dataset was analyzed, comprising experiments designed to investigate different ERP components (ERN, LRP, MMN, N170, N2pc, N400, P3). We systematically varied each preprocessing stage, such as ocular \& muscle artifact correction, low- & high-pass filtering, re-referencing, detrending, baseline correction, artifact interpolation and artifact rejection. Decoding (i.e., classification of trial labels by the neural data) was performed based on each forking path, either trial-wise using deep neural networks or Time-resolved using logistic regression.
