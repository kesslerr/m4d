# Models

The eegnet_ and sliding_ csv files contain the results (single accuracy values or T-sums) for each experiment, forking path, and participant.

The files with _extended are the one from the multiverse reported in the main manuscript.

The files are maybe too large for GitHub, and can therefore be downloaded on [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/records/14223514).

The folders eegnet and sliding contain the single values. They are created by parallel processes and therefore saved into single files, which are then merged in the large csv files. The single files don't contain any additional information.
